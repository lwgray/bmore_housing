Objective
------------
The objective of this project is to predict saleprices for properties in Baltimore City based on Real Property Data

Current Stage
-------------
I am still data munging.  The data needs a lot of work before analysis.
I have commented in the jupter notebook what I have done thus far.

If you would like to participate please let me know.
